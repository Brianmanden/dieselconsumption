Code:
	- average function (Km. per liter)
		- sanitize input (check for null/empty, numbers only etc.)
			- HTML5 deals with this :)

Sheet:
	- fix timestamp to include time as well as date
		- set it in Google Sheet
	- fix wrong average (wtf is going on ?)
		- find out which custom number format to use
			- should have 4 digits
			- should get correct input from JS
